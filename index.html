    <button id="button1">I'm doing great!</button>
    <button id="button2">Not so hot...</button>
    <div id="divider1">
      <p>That's wonderful to hear!</p>
      <button id="button3">What about you?</button>
      <button id="button4">What's your name?</button>
      <div id="divider3">
        <p>I'm doing fine, actually. Programming this was kind of a pain, though, but hey, pressing buttons is fun, right?</p>
        <button id="button5">You might be having too much fun with these buttons...</button>
        <div id="divider4">
          <p>Hey, I paid good money for these buttons! I ought to get my money's worth out of it.</p>
          <button id="button6">Wait, really?</button>
          <div id="divider5">
            <p>No, they were free. I just saw someone else do the same thing and I felt the urge to do it here.</p>

      <p>Aw. I hope everything will get better for you!</p>

    <div id="divider6">
      <p>I have no name, but I have a creator, and his name is Lucas.</p>
      <button id="button7">Lucas, huh?</button>
      <div id="divider7">
        <p>Yes. Do you have any questions?</p>
        <button id="button8">What is he like?</button>
        <button id="button9">Why did he make you?</button>
        <button id="button10">No questions here.</button>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div id="divider8">
      <p>Lucas is an individual who seems calm and passive, but online, he's hyperactive and energetic. He barely sleeps on weekends because he wants to enjoy the weekends to the fullest extent, although he thinks he needs to fix his sleep schedule.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="divider9">
      <p>He made me for multiple reasons. One, he made me for a final school project in Computer Science. Two, he created me to test his limits in writing code in JavaScript, CSS and HTML. I'd say he did a good job, wouldn't you agree?</p>
    </div>

    <div id="divider10">
      <p>Alright, then. I bid you farewell.</p>
